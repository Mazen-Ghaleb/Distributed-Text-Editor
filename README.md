# Distributed Text Editor

A distributed text editor that is distributed over multiple clients and/or servers, with the clients being able to contend for shared resources (i.e. the documents) and perform real-time updates to a shared state (i.e. editing the documents). The system is able to handle the crash of any of the participating nodes and can recover the state of a crashed node once it can resume operation.
